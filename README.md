## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
-   View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   JavaScript
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned how to implement dropdown buttons in Vanilla JavaScript

### Continued development

Dropdowns are probably easier and faster to create using Bootstrap so I'll try that next time.
